				<h2>Mission Statement</h2>			
				<div id="missionContent">
					<p>The goal of this website is to produce a site that had the potential to promote more cycling in city areas, which would hopefully lead to helping to improve the greater health and environment of people in urban areas. To provide people with an easy reference to all local cycling resources they could avail of, and to promote local bike trails and other amenities that most people may not be aware of, all with the intent of raising awareness and hoping that this may help engage more people and encourage them to give cycling a go.  </p>
